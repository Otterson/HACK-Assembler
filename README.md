# HACK Assembler
 C++ code for converting HACK assembly code to binary machine code

This code is for CSCE312 at Texas A&M University as part of a series of assignments designed to give
students a full idea of how high level code gets translated and reduced to binary machine code used by the computer itself.
The main program reads from the included .asm files and translates the instructions given to a 16 bit binary value to
be used by the machine, outputted as a .hack file.
